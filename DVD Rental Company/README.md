In this SQL project, we use an Entity Relationship diagram for the sample DVD Rental Company to author the code needed to create an SQL report for the DVD Rental Company.

The real-world business task that we will be addressing today is the DVD rental store business has decided to implement a new loyalty and rewards program for its top customers to show their appreciation. With this new rewards program, 
the top rental customers will receive discounts and coupons monthly to incentive them to shop more and feel appreciated for their current business. The data that we will be using to create a report to identify these customers will come from the dvd rental database which houses all rental information to our stores.

In our SQL code we do the following:

- Create a Details Table.
- Create a Summary Table.
- Create a function to transform data.
- Create a Trigger on the Details table to update the Summary table.
- Create a Stored Procedure.
- Execute a Stored Procedure.
- Create SFW(Select-From-Where) query to verify.
