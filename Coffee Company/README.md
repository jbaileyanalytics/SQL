In this SQL project, we use an Entity Relationship diagram for the sample Coffee Company to author the code needed to create an SQL database for the Coffee Company.
In our SQL code we do the following:

- Create all tables needed for the Coffee Company based off the ER diagram.
- Assign our Primary & Foreign keys. 
- Insert a set of 'test' values to our tables.
- Create a View.
- Create an Index.
- Create and test a SFW (Select-From-Where) query.
- Create and test a SFW (Select-From-Where) query with multiple joins.
